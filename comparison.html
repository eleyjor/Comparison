            <br>
            <article>In Naruto Shippuden i enjoy mainly the dialouge from the japenese dub. I felt more emotion coming from the japanese voice actors, but mainly the story backgrounds of each characted interested me more so i decided to watch more. I enjoy how each character's background story gives me the feeling of having a relation to him or her. I also enjoy how the japanese version does not cut scences due to too much gore for the english audiance.</article>

        <br>
        <article>I disliked how the english dub version got demonitized alot, certain scences were cut, most of the gore was blured out, and also most of the lines were redubbed to more appropiete words for disneys audiance. I also disliked how most of the newer episodes got repatative with the same main idea around the episode with unneeded characters and story plots.</article>
